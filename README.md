<h2>ffbe-trust</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It runs continously for 1 hour and 55 mins since the trial version of Ankulua only runs 2 hours a time.</li>
  <li>The cool-down time after running 1 hour and 55 mins is roughly 18 mins. You may clean your item slots or empty the arena balls during this period.</li>
  <li>If FFBE crashes, it will resume automatically after around 20 seconds.</li>
  <li>When selecting companions, it always choose the first column. So make sure to apply filter (e.g. 1-star only) to keep your strong friends unused.</li>
