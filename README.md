  <li>It runs continuously for 1 hour and 55 mins since the trial version of Ankulua only runs for 2 hours a time.</li>
  <li>The cool-down time after running 1 hour and 55 mins is roughly 27 mins. You may clean your item slots or empty the arena balls during this period.</li>
  <li>If FFBE crashes, it will resume automatically after around 120 seconds.</li>
  <li>When selecting companions, it always choose the first column. So make sure to apply filter (e.g. 1-star only) to keep your strong friends unused.</li>
  <li>Memu has its native support of macro recording. You may take advantage of it during cool-down time.</li>
</ul>
